Tell me what it's called.<br>
Who remembers?<br>
Which little one<br>
that is born on earth<br>
yellowish animal<br>

Do not crawl<br>
because it flies,<br>
its slow walking<br>
It goes fast when it flies.<br>

Where there is light is<br>
it was known that it preceded<br>
at night the heart cheers<br>
At the outbreak, the milpa is born.<br>

More who invented it?<br>
Truly, what's his name?<br>
They only gave him the nickname<br>
of the month when it is sown.<br>

(Marce√±o)<br>
