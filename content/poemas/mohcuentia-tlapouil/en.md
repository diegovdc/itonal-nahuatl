Early on they talked about a hummingbird and a bee.<br>
So said the bee: - As you see, who will be the first?<br>
-The Oyamel says "Because I am tall I must go forward!" -.<br>
-Who are we going to hear? Said the hummingbird<br>
Well, the ocote says that, because he has long hair,<br>
and when it is windy it sounds more, it must be the first one-.<br>
So the bee continued in a mocking tone:<br>
-And the oak because it is rubbery and has more strength wants to be the first too-.<br>
-To know the truth I'm going to ask the cloud<br>
-The hummingbird climbed quickly and went to ask the cloud. And when it came down ...<br>
-hummingbird! Hummingbird! What does the cloud say? The bee shouted.<br>
Shaking his head the hummingbird responded with a snap: - It does not say anything.<br>
-Have up again and ask the sun Who is going to be the first? Said the bee.<br>
the hummingbird went up and when he got off like that he said to the bee: -<br>
as you see? This is what the sun tells me: "With my fire and do not warm them!"<br>
How are they going to live? "<br>
-Do not listen to him. Now we ask the earth, we will hear what it says.<br>
This said the bee.<br>
Not to think that you also need the heat of the sun so that everything lives; and began to buzz.<br>
-Earth! Earth! You are listening to us.<br>
Who will be the first? -.<br>
The earth trembled and spoke:<br>
-Who is loading them, that will go forward!<br>
Everything was silent.<br>
The wind began to blow "sh, sh, sh" and asked:<br>
-And where do they leave me?<br>
The bee did not quake and began to buzz saying:<br>
-Look, I am small, and if I do not work, how will the field flourish?<br>
The hummingbird rearing up, calls his attention to the sun and the cloud they see;<br>
and he started screaming at the field and everyone who lives:<br>
-Listen to me and look at me!<br>
We are fighting<br>
and look at the water, you're just laughing!<br>
