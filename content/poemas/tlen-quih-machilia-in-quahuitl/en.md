To the man<br>
I never saw it when I was born<br>
"Just" of the fungus<br>
and a lot of animal that if I saw.<br>

I remember<br>
that in this land, where it grew<br>
in this hill of the canyon<br>
where he lived.<br>

Today, today, he escaped<br>
the one who lived in me.<br>
That animal,<br>
that in me, beautiful flying used.<br>

When I heard that he was going to take me<br>
for your tortiller√≠a<br>
to help<br>
of masonry plinth.<br>

One cut<br>
hard my stem.<br>
The other broke<br>
I hard my branches.<br>

"What's happening to me?"<br>
I said to myself<br>
when in me<br>
it was getting dark.<br>

Who heard me<br>
How did he scream?<br>
For the man<br>
it just creaked.<br>

When one of us<br>
it falls, it trembles.<br>
It is our Mother Earth<br>
that when he cries he cries, it is how he complains.<br>
