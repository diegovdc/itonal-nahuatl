"My blood is watered<br>
my blood is changed<br>
my blood is over<br>
My blood, where are you going?"<br>

So he said<br>
a grandfather.<br>
I looked up<br>
I looked down.<br>

I was small.<br>
And I went to his side.<br>
I cleaned his tear<br>
and so I asked:<br>

Why are you crying?<br>
What are you looking for?<br>
What do you want?<br>
What blood runs out?<br>

He seems to hug me<br>
my father!<br>
It seems that he kissed me<br>
my mother!<br>

When he grabbed me<br>
hand
So he told me:<br>

"Never forget our language.<br>
Do not pluck your flesh.<br>
Learn the good<br>
and leave the bad ...<br>

Do not forget the blood of Emiliano.<br>
Do not forget the blood of Francisco.<br>
And your land works<br>
of our grandparents his office.<br>
Put to the right the homeland<br>
do not go the other way<br>
there is a sacrifice."<br>
