For you they applauded.<br>
You danced for yourself.<br>
More, really, what are you<br>
Ometeotl, Ometeotl.<br>

Mother! Mother!<br>
Unravel it again.<br>
Tell me today again.<br>
What does this story mention?<br>
Who is half alive half dead.<br>

Son son!<br>
Our mothers said:<br>
"These life-giving gods<br>
death springs up in them<br>
Life springs up in them. "<br>

They clap, they dance<br>
in variety of births.<br>
They dance, they applaud<br>
in a variety of deaths.<br>
True! or is it true?<br>

When a seed springs<br>
when variety of life is born<br>
they will circle man, woman.<br>
They will dance, they will applaud.<br>
They are in us, when do we die?<br>

Then they are there when something dies.<br>
When a flower dries<br>
When a tree dries<br>
When variety of life dies.<br>
They will circle again, they will applaud.<br>
And they will laugh.<br>
We will not be.<br>
