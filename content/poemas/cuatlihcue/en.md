Mother Earth<br>
your children<br>
They do not know you anymore.<br>
In these children<br>
Your voice does not figure.<br>

Mordelona skirt<br>
they painted you<br>
Your look<br>
I was scared<br>
So your face.<br>

Your children<br>
see your fissured face.<br>
Your children do not see<br>
wherever your dribble<br>
everywhere you vomited.<br>

How will they know<br>
Do you exhale?<br>
They do not even see you<br>
they leave you naked.<br>

Brothers, brothers!<br>
World they told him.<br>
Mother Earth of Nahuas.<br>
Cuatlihcue named you.<br>
