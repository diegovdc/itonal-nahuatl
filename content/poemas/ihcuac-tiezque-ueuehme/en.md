When we'll be old<br>
when we are alone<br>
We will kiss each other again<br>
again on your face<br>
the perfume of flowers.<br>

Again you hug my neck<br>
and again you caress my hair<br>
although they are few already.<br>
Again you will look in my eyes<br>
whatever is in me is yours.<br>

When they see the grandchildren<br>
that when we kiss our hands tremble<br>
when people murmur for us.<br>
They will never understand the sacred way<br>
of these two lovers.<br>
