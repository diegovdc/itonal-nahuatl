Nahuatl language<br>
of soft sound.<br>
How sad to hear<br>
that you are born when you die!<br>

With sad agony your chest opens<br>
in the belly you suffered<br>
voice capped<br>
battered mother.<br>

How sad to hear<br>
that you die with me!<br>
Nahuatl language<br>
of soft sound.<br>

You die when your singing is not heard<br>
and they do not know your speech.<br>
They do not know your name<br>
Your name, Nahuatl, soft sound.<br>
