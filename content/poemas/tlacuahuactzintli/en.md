Sacro Encino<br>
maybe in you<br>
hope<br>
the blessed man<br>

Because in your being<br>
will dwell<br>
the fire will live in you<br>

Although three times<br>
you die<br>
although three times<br>
you finish<br>

The first time you die<br>
when you cut your stem<br>
the blessed man<br>

The second time you die<br>
Makes you see<br>
and be in hell.<br>

The third time you die<br>
Oh sacred coal!<br>
Giving heat<br>
to the blessed man.<br>

In you sacred charcoal<br>
the blessed copal melts<br>
because I'm waiting to get there<br>
there, where it is named, the sky.<br>
