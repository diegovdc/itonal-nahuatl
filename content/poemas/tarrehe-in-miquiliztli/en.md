Listen, where will you go?<br>
when do you die?<br>
In what heavens will you look?<br>

Listen to me, if you remember<br>
what did they tell us?<br>
Where will you go when you die?<br>

Have you if you remember?<br>
If they killed you!<br>
In Tonatiuh hueical, you arrived.<br>

Pay attention to me!<br>
And look good.<br>
If you died for a son.<br>

In Sencalcoh you arrived.<br>
And the Soateteo<br>
I was waiting for you there.<br>

Listen to me! Look up.<br>
You came to Tlalocan,<br>
if it was the water that killed you.<br>

Now I already got scared!<br>
If I die well<br>
there, in Mictlan, I'll wait for you.<br>
