Two hundred years<br>
they repressed us<br>
and they trampled us.<br>

Some brothers<br>
they placated our voice<br>
they told us "you what you know".<br>

And what they said:<br>
that was done.<br>
And you callabas.<br>

Two hundred years<br>
they rose<br>
and our priest Don Miguel.<br>

Today it is called Dolores Hidalgo<br>
where the chimes sounded<br>
well fall early in the morning.<br>

Two hundred years<br>
we will remember our way<br>
we will see ourselves saddened<br>

Two hundred years<br>
let's see our thoughts<br>
Let's gather our reasons.<br>

Two hundred years.<br>
Today we smile.<br>
Today we will talk.<br>
