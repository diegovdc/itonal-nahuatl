My spirit trembles!<br>
In the distance comes the storm.<br>
I feel the wind in my face.<br>

Will I see another day?<br>
Will I spend the night?<br>
I shudder! ... I shudder.<br>

I'm sighing.<br>
The clouds cover the sun.<br>
I remember starry nights.<br>

I'm sighing.<br>
I do not see my forest anymore!<br>
Where was my walk<br>

And I remember the capul√≠n.<br>
Nopal. How much beans!<br>
I go through my past life.<br>

I want to live.<br>
I love my essence.<br>
He wants to win me the crying.<br>

I'm not a youngster anymore<br>
I'm not in my spring<br>
the winter was born in me ... ahhh!<br>

I've already crossed the spring.<br>
I already tried my summer.<br>
I already felt the dryness of my autumn.<br>

I grab the winter.<br>
Let me die, close your eyes.<br>
Let Mother Earth embrace me.<br>
