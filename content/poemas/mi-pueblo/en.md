I write my verses which letter<br>
I wait with reason mind<br>
before your ear gets tired.<br>

My people come from the _Nahuatlaca_<br>
remind your children<br>
my people are forgotten<br>

I turn them _in no tlahtol_<br>
maybe, maybe something<br>
Revive your mind.<br>

I sing _in no tepeh_<br>
to my archangel, my people<br>
his work, my people.<br>

From my _tepetl_ I would like to teach you<br>
of its flora and fauna<br>
of its wind and its rain.<br>

From its majestic _quanme_<br>
that I saw and that my children<br>
you will never see them again.<br>

From its condensed air: _cualtzin ihuiac_<br>
smell of pine, which smelled<br>
that my children will not be able to smell.<br>

From that time of tender pastures<br>
Beautiful flowers! _Nepapan xochitl_<br>
food of different hummingbirds.<br>

Of its streams with sweet waters: _nonque ameyal_.<br>
Today dry bellies!<br>
What dead flowers with thorns.<br>

Where is _in non mazatl_<br>
that by name<br>
My people had won?<br>

Where is _in coyotl_<br>
that with its lugubrious song<br>
People fled scared?<br>

Where is _in cuanmis_?<br>
Oh wild wildcat!<br>
Only your salea I could meet.<br>

Where are your birds: _nonque xochiboton_<br>
of beautiful trilling<br>
in your flowery field?<br>

Oh my great _Teotl_!<br>
Give strength to my soul to continue<br>
because he is hurt.<br>

Where is _in cihtochtli_ or<br>
_tzin cotoc_ that in another town<br>
had they called him?<br>

Where is _in tecolotl_?<br>
Even though my people die<br>
He has not sung<br>

What can I tell you about me archangel?<br>
That in his temple<br>
it is only saved.<br>

All my people<br>
the "citizen" with garbage<br>
it has contaminated it.<br>

Where are our young people<br>
with rebozos, beautiful faces<br>
by the tanned sun?<br>

Where were the beautiful outfits?<br>
I think "modernity"<br>
He has eaten them.<br>

And where is the union<br>
and the strength of our ancestors?<br>
Today it seems that education has divided them.<br>

_Postscript._

The peoples are metamorphosed<br>
building the world in its wake.<br>
The man in a hurry, does not look<br>
the hole that leaves deep.<br>
