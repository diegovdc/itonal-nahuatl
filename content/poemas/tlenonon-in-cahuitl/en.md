With time life is born<br>
the same time<br>
to the death<br>
it routes us<br>

With what beauty<br>
the flower springs<br>
Much more splendid<br>
at its time the dawn.<br>

It does not take time to look<br>
all in one day.<br>
Not the night, the time<br>
it can go back<br>

In the night time<br>
I can only see running<br>
little lights that look<br>
again the sunrise.<br>

There it is at his time<br>
again the day<br>
walking the same direction<br>
Without letting your being spend time.<br>
